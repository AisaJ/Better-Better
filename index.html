        <h3 id="one">Fitness , Health Or Both?</h3>
         <p id="Intro"> <strong>Fitness</strong> is the ability to perform specific tasks well. Fitness is often very specific to goals or tasks. It involves an activity of some sort that stimulates various systems of the body and maintains a certain condition which is suitable for certain sports/activities.
         </br><strong>Health</strong> is the absence of disease both mentally as well as physically. Health means a person has good physical health, no injuries, diseases or issues, and good mental health and social well being. For example, <em>An athlete can perform with injuries of have lots of mental issues such as depression or drug dependencies, and still be “fit” but not have health.</em></p>

            <h3 id="two"> Find a healthy activity</h3>
            <p>There are different ways in which you can ensure you are living a quality life. You don't have to wear yourself down, try out unheard of drugs or wait for depression to hit you then start therapies. Ah ah! Take care of yourself daily or atleast weekly. <a href="#S3">SEE BELOW</a>:) </p>
            <p><strong>Why it Matters</strong></br>
            We can’t always choose the state of our health. High cholesterol and blood pressure are largely genetic. Accidents cause injuries that last a lifetime. But fitness, on the other hand, is a choice which can be a way to actively work towards a better health.</p>

            <p id="description3"><strong>Diet: </strong>A healthful diet includes a variety of fruits and vegetables of many colors, whole grains and starches, good fats, and lean proteins. Eating healthfully also means avoiding foods with high amounts of added salt and sugar. Some of the benefits of a proper diet are as follows:
           <ul>
            <li>Weight Loss</li>
            <li>Reduced cancer risks</li>
            <li>Diabetes management...etc</li>

          <p id="description4"><strong>Friendships</strong>: Good friends are good for your health. They provide support during bad times, prevent loneliness and give you a chance to offer needed companionship, too. Adults with strong social support have a reduced risk of many significant health problems, including depression, high blood pressure and an unhealthy body mass index (BMI).</p>

        <h3>Success Stories</h3>
        <p> <strong>Melissa: </strong><br> “Gym - It’s the real deal.  The Total Gym has changed my life.  I’ve been using it for about a year and a half & I realized that with my 2 small children I have to keep up with them and had to get in shape."</p>

        <p><strong>Sean: </strong><br>29-year-old, Sean thought he would never enjoy life again without destructive, painful surgery. He had been suffering from scoliosis since his teens, even wearing clothes four sizes too big to hide his severely curved spine.
          Forgoing invasive surgery to correct the problem, he instead turned to yoga. In one month, his back was straighter and he felt confident and ready to take on the world. Berry now spends his time enjoying his favorite sport—scuba diving. </p>

          <p><strong>Dave: </strong><br> I used to like being alone. Keeping all problems to myself and handling them like a man should, atleast that's what I thought I was doing. But things become too overwhelming I was almost giving up. Until a friend who kept nagging to join him in his hiking event and all sorts of exciting activities. Long story short, helped me to find out that some of the problems I had are actually solvable. Asking for help isn't a sign of weakness guys!</p>
